### This is a maze robot solution program

  The default maze is:

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
python  ^3.8
```

# Description
  Explaining the maze, the 'X' are the walls and the '.' the free way the robot can pass
  When the robot makes a move, the '.' will change to '*'

  The robot will start at 0.0 in the first row and column
  The main objective of the robot is to reach the last row and column in 4.4
  The robot can go right, left, or up and go back in its action
  In the end, the code will print the maze solution a list of steps to reach the end

### Obs: If the solution is None, it is because the robot has no way to reach the goal

  If you want you can change the maze.

## Run

  To run this code you'll need python3 only.
  Run the main file (main.py) to see what happen

```
python main.py
```

This command will generate 2 (two) outputs, the maze and the solution found by the robot
