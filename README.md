# Python robot maze solver

### This is a maze robot solution program

  The default maze is:
  ```
    . . . .
    . x x .
    . . . x
    x x . .
  ```

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

```
python  ^3.8
```

# Description
  Explaining the maze the 'X' are the walls and the '.' the free way that the robot can pass through
  When the robot make a movement the '.' will change to '*'

  The robot will start at 0,0 the first row and column 
  The robot main objective is to reach the last row and column at 3,3
  The robot can just com right and down, or backtracking his action
  In the end, the code will print the maze solution a list of steps to reach the end

### Obs: If the solution is None, it is because the robot has no way to reach the goal

  If you want you can change the maze but keep in mind the robot only can go right and down


## Run

  To run this code you'll need python3 only.
  Run the main file (main.py) to see what happen

```
python main.pay
```

This command will generate 2 (two) outputs, the maze and the solution found by the robot
